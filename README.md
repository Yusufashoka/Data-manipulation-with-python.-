# Data-manipulation-with-python. 

## objective statment
 <ul>

  <li>Object Series</li>

  <li>Creating a series from array</li>

  <li>Accessing element of Series</li>
 <li>Accessing Element from Series with Position</li>
 li>Accessing Element Using Label (index)</li>
</ul>

## Challenge
<ul>
  <li>Change the Data into Series</li>
  <li>Convert Series into Array</li>
  <li>How to call data </li>
</ul>

## Analytic technictechnicquie Loc dan iLoc
<ul>

  <li>Example of data that has the same implicit index and explicit index</li>

  <li>when we access one index then what appears is the explicit index</li>
  <li>when we call the explicit index from index 2 to index 3. the value that appears is precisely the implicit index </li>

</ul>

## Benefits Data Frame
<ul>

  <li>Data Frame is a collection of series, with at least one series</li>

  <li>when calling data with the regional.pop syntax it will appear as below because pop is the same as the name of the function in the Data Frame</li>

  <li>In the population area, take data that has been done by the previous data frame </li>

</ul>

## Expected outcame 
<ul>
  <li>Next it does with an explicit index on its population syntax</li>
  <li>add new Colom</li>
  <li>add new line </li>
  <li>combine regional data and additional_area data with concat</li>
</ul>
